        <p>“Our destiny is written in the stars.”</p>
<p>It’s the last day of 2022, 7:45 pm. Let’s summarize the past year.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<h2 id="Plans"><a href="#Plans" class="headerlink" title="Plans"></a>Plans</h2><p>I had a lot of plans in my head. Every plan felt like a commander’s order that tortured the real me to death.</p>
<p>“I need to finish reading this book during the holiday.” Often, I couldn’t finish it, and the progress was slow. I tortured myself.</p>
<p>But this year is different. First of all, I let myself go, and I became a lazy bum. What can you do to me? Second, I think I found the right direction. The previous plans always listed things that I resisted. I didn’t want to face reality, so I put them in the plan and gave them to my future self to solve and face.</p>
<p>This holiday, I executed the plan quite well, even exceeding expectations. The reason is that I really want to understand some ethereum details. I am quite satisfied. I hope to make a good start.</p>
<h2 id="Diary"><a href="#Diary" class="headerlink" title="Diary"></a>Diary</h2><p>I have been writing a diary since I was six years old, and I have been writing for twenty-four years. Sometimes I would reflect on whether I over-reflect, causing me to hesitate when making big decisions and being indecisive.</p>
<p>Later, I found out that it was not the case. I knew in my heart when it was time to make a big decision, but it was difficult for me to describe the time node. I just knew that it was time to leave and it was time to set off. You don’t have to ask me why. If I have to use a metaphor, it’s like a monster in your heart that keeps telling you to change, and it’s time to do it. I have to respect this monster.</p>
<p>Currently, I am quite satisfied with the big decisions in my life. If I am not satisfied, it means that it is not yet time for the decision to reach its conclusion.</p>
<p>“As for life-changing decisions, you must take risks. Significant things always happen by coincidence.”</p>
<h2 id="Age"><a href="#Age" class="headerlink" title="Age"></a>Age</h2><p>It’s too hard to imagine. When I was eighteen or nineteen, I thought thirty was far away. I thought thirty was completely middle-aged. What should I do? I thought I would have a net worth of over 100 million yuan when I turned thirty. Haven’t even crossed ten million yet? Then I can go to hell. That’s what I really thought when I was nineteen.</p>
<p>But when I really reached this age, the reality is that I am still worrying about the next meal, still being criticized by my boss, still anxious and unhappy.</p>
<h2 id="Daily-Work"><a href="#Daily-Work" class="headerlink" title="Daily Work"></a>Daily Work</h2><p>I saw an interview where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Date_with_Luyu">Lu Yu</a> said that she had been doing “Lu Yu You Yue” for twenty years, and her feeling was that “she occasionally gets tired but never annoyed.” When I saw this sentence, I felt I am the opposite. “I am not very tired, but I am annoyed.”</p>
<p>This year, work is still a troublesome thing. Next year, I want to achieve not being too influenced by work on my personal life. Take it easy. Work is not that important. Is others’ opinion important? Thicken my skin a bit. Others don’t care that much. </p>
<h2 id="Experience-and-Creation"><a href="#Experience-and-Creation" class="headerlink" title="Experience and Creation"></a>Experience and Creation</h2><p>Travel more and experience different lives.</p>
<p>This year, I feel my energy decreasing and need a catalyst, like coffee, to forcibly stay alert and face the chaos of life.</p>
<p>Should I still aim higher? Of course, I should still aim higher.</p>
<p>Failure, or being “failed”, is normal, but even in any desperate situation, one should not give up their only  one life.</p>
<p>I want to watch movies, work out, scuba dive, surf, write novels, paint, play games, and write games.</p>
<p>I want freedom.</p>
<p>I like math and beauty. I like comics, detective novels, and imagination.</p>
<p>I like and appreciate creativity.</p>
<p>I hate repetition and being commanded.</p>
<p>I hate hopelessness.</p>
<p>“This is a world of many regrets and beauty.” Yes.</p>
<h2 id="Still-run-towards-the-direction-of-“freely-and-unrestrainedly-wandering”"><a href="#Still-run-towards-the-direction-of-“freely-and-unrestrainedly-wandering”" class="headerlink" title="Still run towards the direction of “freely and unrestrainedly wandering”."></a>Still run towards the direction of “freely and unrestrainedly wandering”.</h2><p>At the end of 2022, I am grateful that the fire in my heart is still burning and there is still fuel. I still hold onto my ideals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Freely and unrestrainedly wandering.” The picture these four words create in my mind is this: it’s snowing heavily outside, but it’s very, very warm inside the house, always warm. There is a lot of food, always enough. I just lie on the couch, covered with a thin blanket, eating snacks and watching movies. It snows for a day, two days, and even if it snows for a year, I don’t care, I only care about snacks and fire. Whether there is enough money or not, I don’t care, I only care about snacks and fire. When I reach a certain age, whether I get married and have children or not, I don’t care. I just stay in my house like this, one day, two days, until I die.</p>
<p>The ideal I want to achieve is to be able to do what I like in my house, without being bound by others, and the gaze of others cannot hurt me. I am free and unrestrained, wandering. Watching the sun rise and fall, snowflakes fluttering, I still only care about my snacks and fire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How are you doing now? Are you free? In 2018, I felt like I was still a long way off, but in 2022, I would say that I’m only three thousand miles away.</p>
<p>God exists, and I firmly believe this. He will lend you a hand when things are out of control. There is always a way out. But when he stretches out his hand, you have to grab it and not let this guy run away.</p>
<p> 2023 will definitely get better. Something big, something big will happen.</p>
<p>Let’s go, 2023.</p>
